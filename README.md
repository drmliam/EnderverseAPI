# EnderverseAPI
An API of all things from the Ender's Game Universe by Orson Scott Card, you'll be able to query from different categories such as Books, Places, Characters, Quotes, Major Events, and Definitions of things from the books and (maybe) movie.

An example of what the character endpoint would include.
Character Name: Ender Wiggin
A List of Book Ids for the books that include him
Maybe a list of chapter IDs
A list of places he's been to 
Characters he is associated with (split into groups of family, allies, enemies, etc.)
A List of events he has been involved in
A list of objects/items he has used
Other character traits (maybe eye color, hair color and other physical descriptions).

With other fanbases having APIs for use by their fandoms (Game of Thrones, Star Wars, Star Trek, Lord of the Rings, etc.) I have found there is a significant gap that is missing from the favorite series of mine that I grew up with. Creating this will hopefully allow fans and nerds to find the truly specific things they are looking for from the series. 

At the moment there is a lot to consider between the type of API, layout, and different languages to make SDK's for to make this a universal project. 
For the start of development I will be using notes from Ender's Game itself, but it will later expand to include everything from the first formic war until Shadows Exile.
