# EnderverseAPI
An API of all things from the Ender's Game Universe by Orson Scott Card, you'll be able to query from different categories such as Books, Places, Characters, Quotes, Major Events, and Definitions of things from the books and (maybe) movie.

All categories mentioned will have their own Endpoint, but will crossreference eachother through ID's.

Initial stages of the API will be generated from the book version of Ender's Game, but will eventually expand to include the whole Ender Collection.

For Example: A character like Ender Wiggin will have a list of books he is in, a list of quotes, places and items hes associated with, and events he was involved in. Also included could be a list of a allies, enemies, and if specified a subset of characters like family members.

This idea is still in the formative stage, Type of API needs to be chosen, as well as hosting and what powers it, as well at developing SDK's so that it can be used in an universal experience. In the meantime there are books to reread and take notes from and this will be updated as development begins/continues...

I plan to create this API to fill in the gaps that are currently seen in this fanbase. Many other sci-fi/fantasy series have API's (Game of Thrones, Star Wars, Star Trek, Lord of the Rings, etc.) and its about time someone creates this for the favorite series of so many of us.
